# COMP-330-Team-B-Project-1

This program organizes information based on an input of clues into specific groupings. Information is divided by categories and each individual item is a part of at least one category.

Programs under src/main file:
FinalRunner.java is the official user-interface program where they would enter in their information and clues, and the program would return the final groupings.
Node.java is the basic structure for how the information is stored and organized as with their fields being the item name and category type.
Runner.java is an intial runner that was used to test program functionality without having to enter every piece of information through a user-input program.
WeightedGraph.java is the backbone of this program in that it contains all the fields and methods used by all other programs in the file.
WeightedGraphTest.java is the test class used to prove that the public methods written in WeightedGraph.java work.
The problem used for this testing is based on this websites example:https://www.braingle.com/brainteasers/teaser.php?op=2&id=45084&comm=0
