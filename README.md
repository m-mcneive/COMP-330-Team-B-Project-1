# COMP-330-Team-B-Project
COMP project4 is a different earlier version I did before David had incorporated the recurring change for Another Runner class.
The src file holds the current iteration where I have only changed Another runner to not have the import Arrays package and I closed the scanner 
at the end of the program.

10/9/2019
Most updated version located under src file
Biggest change is adding of a test class to weighted graph to prove methods work
had to change graph variable to public so remember to change that in weighted graph if you want WeightedGraphTest3 to work.
